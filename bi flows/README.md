## MICROSOFT BI FOR FLOWS

In this folder, you will find BI dashboard EXAMPLES TO CONNECT TO THE PTV Flows API.

### Steps to Get Started:

1. Import the WHOLE FOLDER (e.g. kpistatsAndCurrentValue)
2. click on the main file e.g. kpistatsAndCurrentValue.pbip
2. PUT your API key from  PTV Flows instance as a parameter of the BI query (click on the Home tab -> Transform data ->  Edit parameters and edit "apikey" parameter).
3. Refresh the data, if prompted about type of connection select "anonymous connection" (the API  KEY will be used anyhow in the dynamic query). If prompted , set the appropriate privacy level (if you are not planning to share the bi views you could choose to ignore the privacy level)
4. Start exploring and interacting with your dashboard!
